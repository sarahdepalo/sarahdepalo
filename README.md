## Hi there, I'm Sarah! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently attending DigitalCraft's full-stack bootcamp and am loving the challenge and learning everything I can about web development. I enjoy debugging, designing, and working with all things JavaScript and CSS. When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking up new recipies, reading horror books, and petting every dog I see.
