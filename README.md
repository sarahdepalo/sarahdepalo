## Hi there, I'm Sarah! ðŸ‘‹

Recent full-stack bootcamp grad that loves the challenge and learning involved with coding. I enjoy debugging, designing, and working with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking up new recipes, reading horror books, and petting every dog I see.
