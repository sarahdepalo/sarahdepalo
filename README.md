## Hi there, I'm Sarah! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently attending DigitalCrafts full-stack web developer bootcamp. I enjoy working with all things CSS as well as debugging and working with data and APIs. I don't have a ton of spare time outside of homework and class, but you can usually find me cooking new recipies, reading manga, and petting every dog I see.
