<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Sarah! 👋 </h1> 

Recent full-stack bootcamp grad that loves the challenge and lifelong learning involved with coding. I enjoy debugging, designing, and working with React. When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking up new recipes, reading horror books, and petting every dog I see.
